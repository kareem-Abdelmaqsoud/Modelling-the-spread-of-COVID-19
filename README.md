## Modeling the spread of COVID-19 in the US using the SIR model
The purpose of this project predicting the number of COVID-19 infectants globally using a modified version of the SIR model.

Statistical analysis was done one the predictions to prove  the hypothesis. First, since linear regression is used to improve the output of the model, one of the assumptions is that the noise is normally distributed. So, by histogramming and doing a Shapiro-Wilk test the normality of the residuals can be tested. Second, the regression model is also justified using a spearman correlation test. Third, to test how far off the fitted value from the actual value, the standard error of residuals is calcualted.
